Your project registration for ACOS Forge has been approved.

Project Full Name:  projectb ' & Z
Project Unix Name:  projectb

If you visit your
own project page in ACOS Forge while logged in, you will find
additional menu functions to your left labeled 'Project Admin'.

We highly suggest that you now visit ACOS Forge and create a public
description for your project. This can be done by visiting your project
page while logged in, and selecting 'Project Admin' from the menus
on the left (or by visiting http://{site}/project/admin/?group_id=7
after login).

Your project will also not appear in the Trove Software Map (primary
list of projects hosted on ACOS Forge which offers great flexibility in
browsing and search) until you categorize it in the project administration
screens. So that people can find your project, you should do this now.
Visit your project while logged in, and select 'Project Admin' from the
menus on the left.

Enjoy the system, and please tell others about ACOS Forge. Let us know
if there is anything we can do to help you.
