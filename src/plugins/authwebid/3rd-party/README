The plugin relies on a patched version of libAuthentication (original at https://github.com/melvincarvalho/libAuthentication), downloaded from https://github.com/WebIDauth/libAuthentication.

The code here is a snapshot of 02b192e87f1d972c620726aa037f24bf0692ceed which was checked-out from github on 2011/09/01 with git clone git://github.com/WebIDauth/libAuthentication.git

Attention, it uses ARC2 internally, which may be also included by other plugins but with different paths
