fusionforge-plugin-authwebid
-----------------------------

This is meant to be the external WebID authentication plugin for FusionForge.

If the plugin is activated by a user in its account management page, then 
he/she may login to FusionForge using WebID (provided that the plugin is 
activated on the whole site/forge, of course).

Any number of WebID identities (URLs) can be used by a forge user to authenticate.

Only one user may use an WebID identity simultaneously.

WebID identities must have been added through the account management's WebID tab, 
and are associated to the user, provided he/she owns them (i.e. can successfully 
log-in to these URLs).

The logged-in session is granted full privileges of the user, for now. 
This should be improved in a later version, as WebID may not be trusted for critical 
operations on the forge.

The code depends on libAuthentication : https://github.com/melvincarvalho/libAuthentication

USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISKS : THIS IS JUST A VERY EARLY PLUGIN, AND NO SECURITY AUDIT WAS CONDUCTED !
